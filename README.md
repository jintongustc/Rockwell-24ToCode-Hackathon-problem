###Problem statement

Create a prediction algorithm for monitoring anomalies in an electronic assembly manufacturing process by
looking at monitoring and forecasting nozzle performance in pick and place machines.
Goal: Explore a solution with tools of your choice that will introduce as much automation as possible. In real industry,
the cost of manual rework is $10, but if can predict failure before the failure, the cost is only $1. So the object is to
minimize the cost.


### Data Input

JSON files, with Nozzle id for each nozzle, and unique Machine id for each machine. And for each time stamp, and the condition
of the nozzles(failure or not failure)

### The old method

Plot the performance pattern, and predict the failure by threashold.
